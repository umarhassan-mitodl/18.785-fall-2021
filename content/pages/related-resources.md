Magma is a closed-source computer algebra system focused on number theory, group theory, and algebraic geometry. There is a handy {{% resource_link "45c6a9c6-86a6-40b4-960d-2e979949352d" "online calculator" %}} for quick calculations, and a command line interface that you can run from many of the math department servers (type **magma** at the command line).

### {{% resource_link "94d2e7de-d51a-4eaf-8765-8079657826fa" "PARI/GP" %}}

PARI/GP is an open-source computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory. PARI is a fast C-library and GP is a script language interface to PARI that runs in an interactive shell (command-line only, no browser interface). Many Sage functions are implemented using PARI (you can directly call PARI and GP functions from within Sage).Â

Sage is an open-source computer algebra system that includes extensive support for number theory. {{% resource_link "fdab4099-0541-4c2f-99a0-d97a576da44b" "CoCalc" %}} (formerly SageMathCloud) provides a notebook interface to Sage that runs in any browser and is hosted in the cloud; no software installation is required and there is no cost to register for an account. You can also {{% resource_link "21674f11-34aa-42c7-8a72-69ea56e6e7a7" "download" %}} a copy of Sage to run on your own machine if you wish.
